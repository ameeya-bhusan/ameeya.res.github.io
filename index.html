        <img src="images/profile2.jpg" alt="Your Name's Profile Picture" class="profile-pic">
        <p>“The noblest pleasure is the joy of understanding,” said Leonardo da Vinci—a sentiment that profoundly reflects my pursuit of knowledge. For me, science is the key to unlocking the fundamental truths of our universe, and theoretical and computational science is the lens through which I strive to uncover them. My vision is to leverage advanced simulations and theoretical insights to tackle pressing scientific challenges, contributing to a future enriched by innovation and discovery. I am eager to refine my skills, expand my understanding, and contribute meaningfully to groundbreaking research. My academic journey, culminating in a Master’s in Theoretical and Computational Chemistry from the Central University of Punjab, India, in July 2022, has equipped me with a solid foundation and a relentless drive to explore the uncharted frontiers of materials science.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am aspiring to embark on a Ph.D. journey and look forward to contributing to pioneering research at the intersection of conventional quantum chemistry and machine learning that bridges theoretical understanding with practical advancements.</p>

        <h2>Introduction to My Research</h2>
        <p>My research journey has been driven by the desire to address complex scientific problems in theoretical and computational chemistry, employing advanced quantum chemical methods and data-driven approaches. Below, I summarize the critical aspects of my research experience, highlighting the challenges, methodologies, and insights gleaned.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen Formation in the Interstellar Medium: During my Master’s thesis, I investigated the catalytic role of pyrene surfaces in molecular hydrogen (H${_2}$) formation, a crucial process in the interstellar medium. Using the Coupled-Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) method and def2-TZVPP basis set, I generated a two-dimensional Potential Energy Surface (PES) for the recombination reaction of hydrogen atoms. This involved calculating over 4000 single-point energies of H-atom positions relative to the pyrene surface using the ORCA software. The constructed PES revealed the energetics and catalytic behavior of pyrene under interstellar conditions, highlighting the role of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as potential sites for H${_2}$ synthesis. This study contributed to the understanding of astrochemical reaction mechanisms and the catalytic potential of interstellar materials.</p>
        <p>High Entropy Alloys for Hydrogen Storage: At the CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, my work focused on designing high-entropy alloys (HEAs) for hydrogen storage, addressing the critical need for sustainable energy solutions. Using the Evolutionary Algorithm in the USPEX code, I predicted the crystal structures of Mg-Ni-V and Ti-Cr-Mn-based alloys. These structures were further refined through Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP). I conducted phonon dispersion and hydrogen diffusion studies to evaluate the alloys' stability and storage capacity, identifying promising candidates operable at room temperature. and to understand the hydrogen mobility through these materials we conducted thermostat ab-initio Molecular dynamics, which highlighted the effect of alloy to the diffusion of hydrogen contributing to the process of hydrogen sorption. Additionally, I explored the effect of ferrovanadium alloying, analyzing changes in electronic structure and hydrogen absorption properties. This research culminated in two manuscripts under preparation for publication.</p>
        <p>Development of HyStor Database: My contributions to the HyStor database involved integrating extensive datasets of hydrogen storage alloys from experimental and patent literature, adding 451 new compositions to the repository. By categorizing compositions into Low, Medium, and High Entropy Alloy classes, I enabled the training of robust machine learning models, improving property predictions. This resource is now publicly available, enhancing accessibility for the hydrogen storage community, published by \textit{International Journal of Hydrogen Energy} aiding in the rapid discovery of efficient storage materials. My contributions to the HyStor database involved curating data on 1282 metal alloys, significantly enhancing predictive models for hydrogen storage capacity using machine learning, with improved metrics (R² = 0.79, MAE = 0.29).</p>
        <p>Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLEDs): In a collaborative project on OLEDs, I explored the electronic structure of tris-(8-hydroxyquinolinato)aluminum (Alq${_3}$) on a silicon substrate. My research examined how molecular orientation impacts substrate work function, using DFT calculations to derive projected density of states (pDOS). I identified shifts in energy levels correlating with the molecule's spatial configuration, providing insights into optimizing electronic properties for improved device performance. This work is under review in Physical Review B and represents a critical step in understanding charge transport and efficiency in OLEDs.</p>
